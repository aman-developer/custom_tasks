<h3>2) Implement Shipping Calculator on Cart Page.</h3>
<p>I have created the Shipping Calculator on Cart page with three fields. So whenever we fill the information in the fields like Country name, State name and Zip/Postal code then it will show the shipping price according to your location.</p>

<h3>3) ##PRICE##  left for Free Shipping   (Set a Threshold Value in customizer)</h3>
<p>For offering free shipping to customers, created the settings where the particular threshold value is set up in the backend. So if that particular threshold value is reached then only customers get free shipping otherwise notification messages will be shown to customers.</p>

<h3>4) Implement Line Item Properties on a particular product.</h3>
<p>I have created the product and added one option /field through the metafield. So that it will be added into the cart as a line item property. When we enter the name on the product name field then it will be shown on product page as preview but when on cart page it will pass as line item property and also on checkout page so will get to know what customer set as product name or options.</p>

<h3>5) Linked options</h3>
<p>I have created the settings for the linked option, when we click on the colour variant then it will show the size who are available for particular colour variant.For e.g when we select the yellow colour then it will show the particular size option which is available under the yellow colour variant.</p>

<h3>6) Create Swatches instead of dropdown variant options</h3>
<p>I have created the swatches for the variant on the product page, instead of dropdowns it will be shown as colour swatches in circular form. So it will be easy to click on swatches and check that a particular colour image will appear.</p>

<h3>7) Checkout after click of agree to privacy terms </h3>
<p>I have made the “agree to privacy terms” condition mandatory on the checkout page. We need to tick on this condition before checkout . Without ticking on this it is not possible toCheckout from cart page.</p>

<h3>8) Title: Accordions on product page</h3>
<p>I have built the accordions on the product page, when we click “+” in the title/heading it will showcase the content as a dropdown. When we click “-” then again content will be hidden from the selected title/heading.</p>

<h3>9) Implement Custom Filters on the Collection Page</h3>
<p>I have implemented the filters on the collection page based on tags. When we click on the particular filter it shows the products which are provided with the particular tag to the products. We need to assign the tags to the products which we want to showcase in filters.</p>
